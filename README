Ported the Ubertooth host code in state of May 5, 2015 to run on Android, including Bluetooth Low Energy sniffing.

Main features:
	
	- Capture Bluetooth Classic packets and display the data.
	- Capture Bluetooth LE packets and display the data.
	- Capture Bluetooth LE packets to a file (custom naming) and save it on the sdcard.
	- Reset a Ubertooth device (needed after capturing).

Tested on a rooted Samsung Galaxy S4. 
Rebuild the libraries with ndk-build.

Thx to George Nychis and Jeroen Hiddink for their great code base.
